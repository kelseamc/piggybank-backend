# PiggyBank Backend üí∞ - Architecture for this API

**"Piggy Bank"** is a student project developed by  <a href="https://www.kelseaportfolio.com/">Kelsea McAllister</a>.

**Check out  PiggyBank here:** https://www.pigbnkapp.com/

For the _PiggyBank_ Backend we are working with a __RESTful API__ built with _Ruby_ on _Rails_. 
Server deployed to _Heroku_ .

I work with 4 main Models in our database: __User__, __Piggy_Bank__,  __Account__, and __Transaction__.
Models were connected the creating ActiveRecord relations. Active Model Serializers were also implemented. 

We have implemented validation where possible on each of our models, in order to control that the data stored in our database is clean and proper ‚ú®
